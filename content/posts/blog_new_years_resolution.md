# Resolutions

In 2017, I made a New Year's resolution to start a website and a
blog. I managed to start a website in 2017, but never quite made it to
the stage where I had a blog, much less being in a position to post to
it regularly.

In 2018, I made a New Year's resolution to lose some weight. I didn't
quite get myself together enough to begin working towards that goal in
2018.

In 2019, I flat out didn't make a goal.


# Goals

Sometime in mid 2019, I began reading about Common Lisp and decided
that it would be fun to document my discoveries and learnings along
the way.

How about I start a blog, and post to it regularly? How about I make
that a New Year's resolution?

In 2017, I did that. And only in 2019 did I get around to
accomplishing that goal.

This blog will be the home of writeups I think too important to
forget, but not important enough to share widely. I'm not expecting
anyone to read it, but it will at least serve as a place for me to get
my thoughts out and explore new ideas.
